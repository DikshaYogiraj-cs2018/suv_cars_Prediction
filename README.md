## suv purchase prediction using logistic Regression

<h2>This article provides the steps to create the machine learning model.</h2>

<big>Classification Algorithm is where the categories are predicted using categorical data.Classification is a Supervised Learning approach in which the computer program learns from the input given to it and this learning to classify new observations.<br/>
  <br/>
Logistic Regression produces results in a binary format which iss used to predict the outcome of categorical dependent variable.<br/>so the outcome should be discrete / categorical such as:<b> 0 or 1, Yes or No,True or False,High and low</b><br/>
 <br/>
This article provide step by step machine learning model implementation.One can use different machine learning model and find out the accuracy of each model and compare different models with each other and find out which is the best model that can predict the values and may provide better performance.
